# 🔐 OTP Authentication System - User Guide

## Overview

Your application now has a complete **One-Time Password (OTP)** authentication system for both user signup and password recovery.

### Two OTP Flows

1. **Signup with OTP** - Create new account
2. **Forgot Password with OTP** - Reset forgotten password

## 🧪 Testing the System

### Automatic Test Scripts

Run these commands to test the complete flow:

```bash
# Test 1: Complete signup flow
node test-complete-signup.js

# Test 2: Forgot password flow
node test-forgot-password.js
```

Expected output should show:
```
✅ OTP received
✅ OTP verified successfully!
✅ Auth token received
✅ User created
🎉 TEST PASSED!
```

---

## ⚙️ How It Works (Technical)

### OTP Generation
- 6-digit random number
- Hashed using bcrypt before storage
- Saved to MongoDB with 10-minute expiration
- Auto-deleted by MongoDB after 10 minutes

### OTP Verification
1. User receives OTP in email
2. User submits OTP through form
3. Server validates OTP against stored hash
4. If valid: User account created OR password updated
5. If invalid: Error message shown

### Security Features
- ✅ OTP never stored in plain text
- ✅ OTP automatically expires after 10 minutes
- ✅ Passwords stored as bcrypt hash
- ✅ JWT token for session management
- ✅ Email verification prevents unauthorized access

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)

```env
# SMTP Configuration
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key

# Database
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/Plant
```

### Setting Up Gmail SMTP (Optional)

If you want to actually send emails:

1. Go to [myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
2. Select "Mail" and "Windows Computer"
3. Generate an app password (16 characters)
4. Add spaces in groups of 4: `xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx`
5. Copy to `.env` as `SMTP_PASS` (without spaces: `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Network error while sending OTP"

**Cause**: Email sending failed (common in development)

**Solution**: Check server logs for the generated OTP:
```
🔐 Generated OTP for user@example.com: 123456
```

Use this OTP in the frontend.

### Issue: "Invalid OTP"

**Cause**: OTP doesn't match or has expired

**Solution**:
1. Request a new OTP (valid for 10 minutes)
2. Check server logs for the latest OTP
3. Enter the correct OTP

### Issue: "Email already registered"

**Cause**: Trying to signup with an existing email

**Solution**:
1. Use a different email for signup
2. Or use "Forgot Password" to reset existing account

### Issue: "No account found with this email"

**Cause**: Trying to reset password for non-existent email

**Solution**: First create an account with that email

## 📝 Development Notes

### OTP in Development Mode

When `NODE_ENV` is not set to `production`:
- OTP is returned in API response as `debugOtp`
- OTP is logged in server console
- Allows testing without email setup

### Server Logs

Look for these patterns in server logs:

```
🔄 OTP requested for signup - Email: ...
🔐 Generated OTP for signup ...: 123456
✅ OTP saved to database for signup ...
✅ User created successfully via OTP: ...
```

---

## 🚀 Production Deployment

Before deploying to production:

1. **Set NODE_ENV**:
   ```env
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

2. **Update SMTP credentials**:
   - Use valid Gmail app password
   - Or configure your own SMTP server

3. **Secure JWT secret**:
   - Use a strong, random string
   - Store in environment variables only

4. **Database backup**:
   - MongoDB with OTP collection
   - TTL index auto-deletes expired OTPs

5. **HTTPS required**:
   - All API calls must be HTTPS
   - JWT tokens transmitted securely

---

## 📞 Support

For issues or questions:

1. Check server logs: `console` output
2. Verify environment variables in `.env`
3. Ensure MongoDB is running
4. Check network tab in browser DevTools
